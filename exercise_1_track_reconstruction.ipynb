    "Solving track reconstruction\n",

    "Up until now, we have created tracks. However, tracks should fulfill some criteria in order to make sense from a physical standpoint: It wouldn't make sense to have several tracks coming from the same hits, or to join random hits together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically one uses known geometrical constraints alongside problem-specific knowledge in order to determine where to look for tracks, and how should tracks look like. Ultimately, there are five quantities one has to look after:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Reconstruction Efficiency: The fraction of particles we have reconstructed.\n",
    "    > \\# correctly reconstructed / \\# real tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Clone Tracks: Tracks that are similar to other correctly reconstructed tracks.\n",
    "    > \\# clone tracks / \\# correctly reconstructed\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Fake Tracks: Tracks that are incorrect, either created by noise hits or by incorrectly reconstructing a track.\n",
    "    > \\# incorrectly reconstructed / \\# all reconstructed\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Hit purity: Fraction of hits in a track that belong to the same MC particle.\n",
    "    > \\# track hits in MC particle hits / \\# track hits\n",
    "    \n",
    "*   Hit efficiency: Number of hits correctly found out of the MC particle hits in a track.\n",
    "    > \\# track hits in MC particle hits / \\# MC particle hits\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew, that was quite a mouthful. If you want one thing to look for at the beginning, that is to *maximize reconstruction efficiency*. First try to reconstruct as much correct as possible, and work out the other indicators one by one.\n",
